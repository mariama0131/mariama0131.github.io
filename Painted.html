<h1>Painted</h1>
<br/>
<p>
Sometimes, to sober up after a night of heavy drinking, I take my empty bottles and go out to fetch stories, stories of men, stories of the lonely, stories that intertwine like blackthorn trees, sometimes I question the stars, the uncounted sheep, the cackling cicadas that seem to know everything about waking up early because I’m tired of having the same defensiveness for breakfast, the same detachment for drinks, I’m tired of being just an afterthought, a sense of temporary familiarity, I’m tired of standing in the hallway when the room is for family only, I’m tired of stripping down layers, peeling back skin, I’m tired of harboring a hunger that collecting stories no longer feed, I’m tired of never being enough, always the plan B to your company, I’m tired of not saying what I mean, tired of waking up to creases on my sheet instead of the sight of you in the morning...
</p> <p>
I guess what I’m trying to say is I should go cut an onion or something.
