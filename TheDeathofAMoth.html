<h1>The Death of A Moth</h1>


the first time you left the house 
empty-stomached 
I found a moth on the carpet
lying dead 

The leftovers from last night 
sat alone on the table 
like moth on a carpet
and me in my bed 

Every morning since then I mourned 
for the moth that died
I’ve been too busy mourning
to notice the bread has dried

When you packed up our love
once and for all, you left
I ate the dry bread
and blamed the moth for theft 

Last Sunday I turned off the faucet 
the church bells cried
We forgot to water the carpet
And the moth has dried
