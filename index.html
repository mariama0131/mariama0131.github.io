	Haining Ma is a three-time poetry-writing champion in the World Olympic Games against 9 year olds. Her other achievements include: a participation award presented by the NFL (National Flossing League) as well as a nomination for the worst painter ever by the Academy of Asian Representation, which consists of two people––her little sister and her childhood piano teacher. 
	</p>
	<br/><p>
	Her journey began when she visited the temple of the Dalai Llama––The Dalai Lama's pet Llama. She witnessed the eye-opening ritual of the locals, during which people literally circle around the Llama and dance while chanting and praising the art of poetry. Ma was invited to participate, and when it was her turn to chant the words "Oh the beauty of poetry," she accidentally said the world "poultry" instead due to her poor English skills, and the Llama instantly spit in her eyes. 
	</p>
	<br/><p>
	From then on, she felt truly inspired to not only learn English but also get to know the beauty of poetry. In the last few years, she has completed over one hundred poems, half of which she would rather burn than show to anyone. She will forever be grateful to the Dalai Llama for its valuable feedback.

	Currently, Ma lives in Boston and sells cannolis for a living, but when she realized that she could no longer afford chocolate chips and could only make original flavored cannolis, which are so much worse than the ones covered in chocolate chips, she felt the need for a career change and hoped to relive her experience as a poet. 
	</p>
	<br/><p>
	Did she make the right decision to quit her cannoli business? Did I just make up everything on this page? Am I not Ma herself speaking in a third-person voice? I don't know. You read the poems and be the judge.
